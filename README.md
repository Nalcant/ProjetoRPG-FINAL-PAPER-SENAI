# ProjetoRPG-FINAL-PAPER-SENAI
Me and my school group made this project as a "Final Paper", it's not fineshed, 
however we came this far just with our knowledge in C#, so we had to research how to use the Unity Engine , and  the logic behind game program. 
This project is a "RPG table manager"

To run it, you will need any version of unity engine, there are two project versions, one is a local-only project, and the another one is a experimental online mode attempt.
